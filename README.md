# YouTube Clone

# About

This is a practice project where I recreated the basic layout of YouTube using HTML and CSS. It includes navigation, sidebar, video grid, and thumbnails filled with sample data to resemble the YouTube interface.

# Purpose
The main goal of this project was to:

Practice front-end development with HTML and CSS

Get familiar with responsive design and clean UI structure

Learn how to use online resources for images and icons, and practice working with online picture libraries


# Note

This project is only for learning purposes. All images, icons, and other resources were taken from online sources for practice.
